# ExcelToOutlook
An application for moving a work schedule in excel format to an outlook calendar.

Sadly, the original and more complete Java version of this application has been lost to time...

Note: This is a free-time project that was never intended to be seen by others and as such contains very few or no comments to help understand the code.
